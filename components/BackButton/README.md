## Next.js useRouter

As a Single Page Application (SPA) one of the primary features is the Next Router (`next/router`) which allows for integration between the navigation system (typically the browser's History API) and your application code to allow URL changes to control what component(s) are rendered.

The `useRouter` hook is a primary mechanism to integrate programmatic control of the Router into your components. It is relatively easy to mock out the hook function to return inspectable stub functions.
